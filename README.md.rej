 +## Getting started as a NeqSim user
 +A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed in order to run NeqSim. NeqSim can be used in a Java application by adding the NeqSim.jar found in [NeqSim releases](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimsource/releases) to the classpath. A demonstration of downloading the library and running a TPflash  benchmark is illustrated in this [NeqSim Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XkQ_CrVj2gLTtJvXhFQMWALzXii522CL).
